# Rest API with nodejs

It's a study project to apply my knowledges and build a rest api with verbs get, post, put, delete and patch.

This project used node express with mysql, following all best practices used for a good and easy-maintenance api. 

To run you need to type in the root project `docker-compose up -d` to build the mysql container. After that, you can type `npm start` to start the node server.

To execute all endpoints built in project, please import into postman the **postman.json** file.
